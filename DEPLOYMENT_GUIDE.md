- **Backup**: `aiService.backup.js` created for rollback

### **2. Test Script Created**
- **File**: `test-finetuned.js`

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrate fine-tuned Parth AI model"

# Push to repository
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy, or manually deploy from dashboard
```

### **Step 3: Verify in Production**
1. Open your chat interface
2. Test with these prompts:
   - "Bro wassup, which gimbal should I buy?"
   - "The music doesn't feel right, can you help?"
   - "When are you free for a shoot?"

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

Your AI should now:
- âœ… Use natural Hindi-English mixing ("yaar", "bro", "bhai")
- âœ… Sound more like the real Parth
- âœ… Have your authentic personality and humor
- âœ… Provide technical expertise in your style
- âœ… Be professional yet friendly

## ðŸ”„ **Rollback Plan**

If something goes wrong:
```bash
